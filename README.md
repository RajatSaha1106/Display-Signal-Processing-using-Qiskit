Quantum Derivative Pricing using QSP

This repository contains the code for the construction of Polynomial Approximations for genrating Financial Payoffs on Quantum Computers. The language of choice is Qiskit and the circuits have been run on AerSimulator and ocassionally on GenericBackendV2(), the noisy backend of Qiskit.

For all intents and purposes, each of the notebook does what it is named after. The Circuits for European Call pricing and Autocallable Payoff may look the same. But the method of determining phase vector  in both the cases are different, due to the choice of target function f(x) for Minimax Optimization.

Besides the Quantum Circuits, we have also included notebook for pricing classically using Monte carlo simulations and also the canonical Amplitude Estimation Method in Qiskit. 

The bulk of the codes made it impassable to be attached on the main final report.
